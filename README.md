How many votes are required to get a proposal passed

## Data to gather
- quorum thresholds for each proposal (issue is that this can change over time...)

## Questions
- Are there algorithms to automatically determine how many combinations exist?
- Could number of combos to have only 1 voter, only 2 voters... only n votes?
