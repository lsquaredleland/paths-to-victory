# Road to Victory

How many votes are required to get a proposal passed

## Data to gather
- quorum thresholds for each proposal (issue is that this can change over time...)
- Need to get the most current proposal (via global data)
- All the people to vote against to not pass it (look at the combo)

## Questions
- Are there algorithms to automatically determine how many combinations exist?
- Could number of combos to have only 1 voter, only 2 voters... only n votes?


### TEST CASES
- `blockHeight`: 12926675, `protocol`: Compound, `proposalId`: 53

## Future
- branded by Tally (use tally style guide)
- give it's own microsite for now


So the best place to check out our theme is actually from another project. We use ChakraUI to do our components. (It's fantastic)

And you can just pull the whole folder.

and our logo, actually I have to email it to you. Twitter won't let me add a SVG.
